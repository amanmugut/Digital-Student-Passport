I led a team of developers to develop a mobile application named ”Digital Student Passport”. The app contains all the information of the
students as well as faculty members in an institute, in a digital format. I was responsible
for the overall project management, including planning, execution, and quality assurance. I
also worked on the technical aspects of the project, such as the design and implementation
of the backend.

Tech Stack: Android, Google Firebase
Description: An Android application that digitalizes student and faculty information in an
institute, using Firebase for data storage and authentication.
